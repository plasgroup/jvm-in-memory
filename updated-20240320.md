I left a compiler framework I made before to the branch named `ycompiler`.

It is a framework that can quickly generate a **lexer**, an **LR1 parser**, **AST data structures** an **AST interpreter** from a given language mete configuration.

It is equipped with some debug functionality for programming language design debugging, which may be useful in designing a new programming language.

I'd like to complete a language processing system for PIM. But I don't know whether I still have a chance to make it by myself. (I may move to a different research domain).

I would appreciate it if one day it may be implemented by someone. 

It is a large project to make a language processing system for PIM to achieve auto-parallelization and performance&parallism optimizations. 

In the preliminary design, a high-level IR (Graph IR) and a low-level IR for the PIM language processing system are introduced, with equipping functionality similar to user-scheduling/automatic scheduling which is useful in the high-performance computing domain, and make optimization on top of it. The optimization will be a combinatorial problem and has many valuable research themes inside it.
